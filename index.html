				<p> Além das seções transversais presentes na base do programa, o Eberick com o módulo de Pilares com seção composta pode ter diversas seções transversais para os pilares moldados in loco:
					<ul>
						<li> Retangular vazada </li>
						<li> Tipo T </li>
						<li> Tipo U </li>
						<li> Tipo + </li>
						<li> Tipo I </li>
						<li> Tipo L aberto </li>
					</ul>	
				<p> Com a seção transversal de pilar do tipo “L aberto” é possível lançar além do pilar em L tradicional, pilares de concreto moldado in loco em formato L com ângulo entre abas diferente de 90°. Com isso, podem-se lançar pilares em “L aberto” (ângulo entre abas maior que 90°) e pilares em “L fechado” (ângulo entre abas menor que 90°). </p>
				<p> Com estas seções transversais o projetista tem maior liberdade de lançamento para atender as exigências arquitetônicas, além de facilitar o dimensionamento e detalhamento destes elementos no projeto.  </p>

	    	<hr/>
				<p> Com este módulo é possível realizar o dimensionamento de pilares-parede, onde podem existir efeitos de 2ª ordem localizados, provocados pela atuação combinada das cargas e momentos. Nestes casos o programa decompõe a seção do pilar em faixas analisadas isoladamente. Esta verificação é integrada ao processo iterativo de cálculo das armaduras do pilar, atendendo tanto à verificação da seção completa como por faixas. </p>
				<p> Este módulo também incorpora ao Eberick um novo método de dimensionamento de pilares, chamado “pilar padrão acoplado a diagramas MxNx1/r”, com o qual a NBR 6118 permite o dimensionamento de pilares com esbeltez até 140, caso a esbeltez na direção secundária do pilar não seja relevante. Por utilizar-se de um processo mais preciso para determinação dos efeitos de 2ª ordem, em alguns casos também poderá resultar em menores armaduras desses pilares. Com isso o usuário poderá escolher entre qualquer um dos métodos existentes, buscando a alternativa mais econômica ou mais crítica. </p>

				<p>No Eberick estão disponíveis duas formas de cálculo para as lajes, uma delas dimensionando a laje pelos esforços máximos, considerando sempre uma mesma armadura ao longo de toda a laje, e outra considerando regiões de esforços, sendo que o programa passa a considerar regiões diferenciadas de armadura, reforçando a laje onde necessário. Com isso, em muitos casos é possível obter economia de armadura, reduzindo o custo da estrutura. </p>
				<p>No dimensionamento das lajes, o Eberick também considera a atuação combinada dos momentos fletores e torsores (momentos Wood&Armer), cuja abordagem permite, por exemplo, detalhar a laje contemplando os esforços volventes em cantos de lajes, permitindo uma análise mais refinada das lajes do projeto.

Na janela de dimensionamento das vigas também é apresentado um diagrama com a sobreposição dos momentos fletores ao detalhamento das vigas, facilitando o entendimento do resultado e a manipulação das armaduras. Os diagramas de esforços das vigas também serão apresentados no memorial de cálculo. </p>
				<p> Os elementos com erro de dimensionamento são destacados na janela de dimensionamento e para cada erro é apresentada série de informações que auxiliam na solução dos problemas, oferecendo diversas alternativas e permitindo com isso escolher qual a melhor solução para cada projeto. </p>
